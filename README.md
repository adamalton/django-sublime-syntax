### Contributing
To install for development clone this repo (or symlink it) to `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/Django Syntax` on linux. For other operating systems use `Preferences` -> `Browse Packages` to find the location of the Packages folder.

Edit only `Django HTML.sublime-syntax` and use `build.py` to generate the `CSS` and `XML` variants.

Open a Pull Request on GitHub with your changes and the tests will automatically be run.
